Hello world. It’s been a week since I started data science self paced course at Flatiron School. I had zero technical knowledge about data science when I started the course. It has been very challenging so far but I love it.

About a year ago I decided to change my occupation. Before that I was only thinking about money. I had certain goals that I needed to achieve and all my efforts went into it. That left me no time for self development and things that I love to do. Now I want to do what I like and have my job related to that.

So... What do I like? I like movies. I mean I love movies. I watch all of them. I keep updated on all major festivals and awards, I spend free time on rotentomatos and boxofficemojo going through ratings and statistics. Almost every time I can tell if movie is going to be succesfull. It is pretty easy with popular movies and series: 
1. Leading actor/actors. *Is he popular? Do you see him in media often?*
2. Plot. *Is it a popular franchise? Is it about someone famous?*
3. Target audience. *Pg-13 movies target the widest audience*
4. Trend. *What are major news and scandals these years? Are they reflected in a movie?*
5. Number of theaters and release date. *Even a horrible movie will make money on Christmas eve.*

If answer to all these questions is yes movie will be succesfull. Maybe it won't be good but it will make money and that will make it successfull. 

Here is another  exercise for you. In Game of Thrones Tyrion, Jon and Daenerys have most on screen time, they have most lines and all major events in the series are seen through their eyes. They are most mentioned charachters in media. From season 1 to 5 GOT audience has been increasing by approximately 1.5m viewers per season. At the end of season 5 Jon was murdered. Question: Will they resurrect Jon Snow in season 6? That was pretty obvious and thus a bit dissapointing actually.

Ok. I need to stop. I can talk about this for hours. Maybe there is a place where I can apply this passion.

Another thing that always fascinated me was artificial intelligence. I have a story that blew my mind. One day my wife mentioned a strange client she talked to over the phone. She is an insurance agent and she noticed that one particular client gives her same exact answers every time they talk. Simple casual phrases like “Yes, please”, “Maybe tomorrow”, “Didn’t I sign it last time?” and so on. She said that phrases are always the same and she have never met client in person! I wanted to hear it myself. So I came to my wife’s office, she called the number and started the conversation. She actually needed to ask him some questions about his policy. And it felt like a normal conversation. The guy had strong middle eastern accent, was mixing words. When he said “I did it tomorrow, oh I mean yesterday.” it felt so normal! But after two minutes he said it again! Same exact phrase! And then he started to repeat other things. I was in awe! I mean this thing almost passed Turing test. After 5 minutes of conversation I noticed that this algorithm has about 20-25 phrases and it picks one when my wife says certain word or phrase. Most of the it is enough to answer all needed questions.
At that moment I decided that I need to know how this works. 
Linkedin published 2019’s Most Promising Jobs in the U.S. First place - Data scientist. What is it about? Oh it has statistics and machine learning! I like that. I will need to learn programming and lots of other things. This all sounds really exciting I am up for this challenge. 
One of my friends mentioned flatiron school to be one of the best. So here I am.
